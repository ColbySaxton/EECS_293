Gone

	board= The initial board of the game
	replacedPebbleBoard= the board with pebbles replaced on it

	This routine checks if there are any black pebbles remaining on the board after the iterated list of moves occurs. It will return true if there are remaining black pebbles, false if not.
	blackPebblesLeft()
		input~ a board
		Precondition~ For this algorithm to work, the input board must be the board that has already completed all replacements from black to white 
		output~ Whether or not there are any black pebbles remaining on the board

		For all the possible x-y coordinate pairs on the board do the following:
			Check to see if there is a pebble on each coordinate using the pebbleOnCoordinates routine for each coordinates
			If there is a pebble on the location:
				check to see if the pebble is black, if it is:
					Then return that there is a black pebble
				if the pebble is not black:
					Then continue checking all pebbles
		After checking all the pebbles, there were no black pebbles, then return that there are no black pebbles
